# Hanhan-s-Machine-Learning-Model-Implementation
Implement different type of machine learning models to deal with practical problems, majorly using Python

1. Building Price Models
  * Classifiers like Bayesian classifiers, decision trees, SVM can be used for prediction, but may not be the best choices for predictions about numerical data with many different attributes.
  * Check ReadMe_PriceModels.txt for all the details: https://github.com/hanhanwu/Hanhan-Machine-Learning-Model-Implementation/blob/master/ReadMe_PriceModels.txt

2. Advanced Classification for MatchMaker dataset
  * Dating website looks really magical, they match people based on the info each individual provided, the generated dataset is called MatchMaker dataset, which contains both numerical and nominal data.
  * I have practiced advanced classification models like SVM, linear classifiers and kernel methods in this part of code.
  * Finally, I have parsed friends data through Facebook Graph API, then did data preprocessing and finally used SVM to do friends prediction.

3. Searching and Ranking
 * I am creating a basic search engine in this part of code, and there are 4 steps:
   crawling, indexing, ranking, building neural network for ranking queries
 * Check ReadMe_SearchRanking.txt for all the details: https://github.com/hanhanwu/Hanhan-Machine-Learning-Model-Implementation/blob/master/ReadMe_SearchRanking.txt
 
4. Optimization
 * Check ReadMe_Optimization.md for all the details: https://github.com/hanhanwu/Hanhan-Machine-Learning-Model-Implementation/blob/master/ReadMe_Optimization.md
 
5. Decision Tree
 * Check ReadMe_DecisionTree for all the details: https://github.com/hanhanwu/Hanhan-Machine-Learning-Model-Implementation/blob/master/ReadMe_DecisionTree.md
